# ![Icon](docs/icon.png) iFunny Downloader (Chrome Extension)
An extension for chromium based browsers that downloads iFunny images the way they should be

- Removes the ugly watermark off the image
- Saves images with the original readable name instead of the hashed name  
(funny-meme-name.png) instead of (f641d4e390a3a9cf628a243c7cefcc4f25.png)
- Always downloads in png format to be easily shareable (no dealing with webp, tiff, etc)
